I’m a senior undergrad doing math at a tiny liberal arts college in the Pacific Northwest.

I like statistics, R, and Python.

I’m writing a thesis about network models and disease transmission, see my blog for updates.

All the photos were taken by me with a Minolta X-370 in various places in Oregon, Washington, and Maine.
