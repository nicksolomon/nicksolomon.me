For this project, I worked with [Legal Aid of Southeastern PA](http://lasp.org) to help them find patterns in the types of services they provide to different geographic areas in the four counties they serve. Here is an anonymized version of the interactive maps I produced for them. Points were jittered randomly by a small amount, so while exact locations are inaccurate, any overall trends should still be apparent.
